# Quick Started Demos for Ginkgoch Map

## Overview
This project will introduce some demos to guide developers to build their own map based application with `Ginkgoch Map` library. All the projects including server and client code are implemented with JavaScript only. I will progressively add demos from simple to complex scenario; use pure `core` library to some high-level wrapper APIs to simplify the code.

## Concrete Demos
### Quick Started
[This project](https://github.com/ginkgoch/map-quick-started-demos/tree/develop/core) represents several simple demos for [pure map core library](https://github.com/ginkgoch/node-map). In this page, I don't refer any other web, desktop or mobile frameworks to build rich UX application; but use few lines of code to show the power of its GIS functions.

### Build a Customized Map Server
[This project](https://github.com/ginkgoch/map-quick-started-demos/tree/develop/services) will walk you through on how to build a simple interactive map, including a set of RESTful APIs for map render, spatial query, client map view integration and how client interacts with server by RESTful API.
